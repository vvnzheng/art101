		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to code arrays and objects in Javascript. The next steps
			were to understand the variables and understand how to access the inner workings.
			Then, we had to understand their outputs towards the console.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not have any big problems with the code. The only issue was
			remembering the syntax of creating an object and understanding it's references.
			Otherwise, the project was fairly easy.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are the outputs of our work in this lab. It is a showing of the data within
				our arrays and objects in order to describe our modes of transportation.</p>
