	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab was to identify and organize the local file structure
		on my laptop as well as learning how to transfer files as shown with the img folder</p>
	<h2>Challenges:</h2>
	<p>Creating the file structure was easy since the files were already created for us.
		It was also already organized in Atom, so we did not need to do much if we had not
		edited anything. After looking through my folders and files, I had no errors with
		the rest of the lab.</p>
	<h3>Results:</h3>
	<p>Here is the image of my lab showing the results of my work. It showcases
		the file structure in Atom.
