		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to pick a daily task in real life, a computer task,
				and then translate both into pseudocode.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had a few problems understanding the directions of the lab. My partner
				Tatum, managed to explain clearly to me how we were supposed to include
				our pseudocode within the index.html file and the js file. Otherwise,
				implementing the pseudocode and deciding on tasks had no issues.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<div id="underline">
				<p>Here is our pseudocode for our everyday task, ‘making a sandwich’:</p>
			</div>
				<li>Gather ingredients</li>
					<div id="indent">
						<li>Bread, meat, cheese, veggies, and sauce</li>
					</div>
				<li>Lay out two bread slices</li>
				<li>Put sauce on both bread slices</li>
				<li>Layer meat, cheese, and veggies on one of the bread slices</li>
				<li>Put bread slice on top of the meat, cheese, and veggies</li>
				<li>Cut sandwich</li>
				<li>Eat sandwich</li>
			<div id="underline">
				<p>Here is our pseudocode for our computer task, ‘madlib’:</p>
			</div>
				<li>Set up story template with empty variables representing ‘blanks’</li>
				<li>Have the user input words for the madlib</li>
					<div id="indent">
						<li>Computer would ask for diff word types (verb, noun, ect)</li>
					</div>
				<li>Assign user input to the empty variables</li>
				<li>Print final story with variables replaced with user input words</li>
			<div id="underline">
				<p>Here are our Javascript comments for our computer task:</p>
			</div>
			<div id="codesection">
				<pre><code>
					//For our computer task, we decided to pick ‘mad lib.’
	  				//Set up story template with empty variables representing ‘blanks’
	    			//Loop through variables in a list
	      			//Have the user input words for the madlib
	      			//Assign user input to the empty variables
	  				//Print final story with variables’ data replaced with user input words
					</pre></code>
