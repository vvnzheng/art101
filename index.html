			<p>Hi! I'm Vivian and I'm a third year Computer Science Game Design major
				at the University of California Santa Cruz. I currently work as a
				waitress at a restaurant in Santa Cruz. I've also worked as a fast food
				line worker and a tutor for both children and university students.
			</p>
			<p>I have a few amount of hobbies, I love reading, drawing, and skateboarding.
				Lately I have been really into buying comics and manga. Sometimes I'll be
				embroidering or building lego sets in my free time as well.
				I have also raised a lot of animals such as ducks and chickens
				and I currently have a roborovski hamster named Teacup.
			</p>
