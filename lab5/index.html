		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to code in Javascript and learn about different variables and data types.
			Including how to manipulate them and connect them with html.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not have any major issues with the Javascript itself. The only issue was
			understanding concatenation of strings which I explained to him. Otherwise, connecting the two
			files was fairly easy. We also explored how to change the color of Javascript output.</p>
	</div>
	<div id='section'>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are the results of our lab. We outputted different colored text about the details of a car
			and linked a related image for our websites.</p>
